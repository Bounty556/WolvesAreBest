                <p>Why are wolves so freaking cool? Well first of all, wolves have a highly sophisticated social structure which allow them to hunt even the smartest of prey. Speaking of their social structures, they're one of the few animals that attempt to mate for life.</p>

                <p>Wolves also are masters of efficiency. If they kill an animal, they almost never leave much of the carcass. If need be, each wolf in a pack can eat up to 9kg of meat in one sitting. When hunting their prey, wolves tend to rely more on their smarts and sheer number, as they actually don't run that fast. Contrary to popular belief, wolves only have a top speed of 28 mph!</p>
